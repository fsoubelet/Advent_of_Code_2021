# Advent_of_Code_2021

This repository contains the code for my [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) solutions.
I've decided to take this opportunity to both try out [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) and get some practice with [taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi) when it seems relevant.


## Running

Solution programs as well as exercises prompts and inputs are included in the repository.

Any program can be ran by moving into the relevant directory and calling it directly.
For instance, running Python solution for the second challenge of day 1 would go as:
```bash
cd python/day_01
python second.py
```

Similarly for Julia:
```bash
cd julia/day_01
julia second.jl
```

## Requirements

You need a working `Python` and `Julia` installation.
I will try to update the requirements for both languages as I go.
For now, the needed external packages are:

|    **Python**     |     **Julia**     |
| :---------------: | :---------------: |
|   `numpy`    |                   |
|   `pandas`    |                   |
|   `matplotlib`    |                   |
